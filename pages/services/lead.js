          A Lead generation services provider manages campaigns to discover and
          qualify customers for businesses, also known as leads. These services
          can be highly beneficial in filling an organizationâ€™s sales pipeline
          with potential clients; providers can also assist with establishing
          initial communications and building interest in the brand (demand
          generation). A number of these providers will assist with follow-up
          campaigns and other "lead nurturing" to ensure the best possible
          conversion rate.
